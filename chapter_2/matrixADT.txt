A matrix is a collection of scalar values arranged in rows and columns
as a rectangular grid of a fixed size. The elements of the matrix can 
be accessed by specifying a given row and column index with starting at 0.

- Matrix(nrows, ncols): Creates a new matrix containing nrows and ncols
with each element initialized to 0.
- numRows(): Returns the number of rows in the matrix
- numCols(): Returns the number of columns in the matrix
- getitem(row, col): Returns the value stored in the given matrix element.
Both row and col must be within the valid range.
- setitem(row, col): Sets the matrix element at the given row and col to 
scalar. The element indices must be within the valid range.
- scaleBy(scalar): Multiplies each element of the matrix by the given scalar
value. The matrix is modified by this operation.
- transpose(): Returns
